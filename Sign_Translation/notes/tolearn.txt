cache-first-strategy
looks in the cache first, and then it falls back to the network.

waiting state: old data, particularly the old website will be loaded in until the app is closed. Only then will it check for updated data.
	For development, this can be annoying as it will cause the old website to be loaded 
	regardless of changes you make, so it is recommended to keep this off until you are 
	ready to test online.
	To test, run a standard http build server: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/

	The link talks to the server about what information it needs, and the server returns the
	data of that page. It then calls a refresh to the user's computer to reload that page
	with the new content.
React Router: Specific type of client-side-routing that has its own component handle the routes to find what the end URL link should be.
